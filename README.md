# Do What It Says

Screen Shot:

   * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's        commands.

     * It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.

     * Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this.
